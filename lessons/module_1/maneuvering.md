# Lesson 4. Maneuvering

## Objective
Learn about functions for turning the rover right and left.

## Introduction
You have successfully learned how to control the rover's forward and backward movements, but this is not sufficient for free movement across the field. In this lesson, you will learn functions for turning the rover right and left.

## Theory
You already know how to control the rover for straight movement; now, let's delve into turning the rover right and left to facilitate movement in four directions.

Below, the image represents the possible directions of the rover's movement.

**rover.turnRight()** - Function for turning right.

**rover.turnLeft()** - Function for turning left.

As you can see, the turning functions don't require any parameters. It's sufficient to call them, and the rover will turn in place in the desired direction.

## Assignment 
Write code for the rover to **turn right, then turn left, and finally turn left again**.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! Now you can move the rover in four directions! This skill will prove very useful for you in the next lesson.
