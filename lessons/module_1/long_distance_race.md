# Mars Rover Mission Simulator

## Lesson 5: Your First Mission

### Introduction

Now that you know how to control the rover's movements in four directions, this lesson requires you to craft a sequence of commands to guide the rover along a predefined route. This task is very similar to what NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) engineers do every day.

### Theory

Throughout the preceding lessons, you've been creating programs. A **program** is an ordered sequence of commands. These commands are executed by a designated executor, which, in our case, is the rover. The rover's on-board computer executes each command in the order you write them, ensuring it completes its assigned tasks autonomously.

Each function within the `rover.h` library executes a sequence of commands specific to that function. In the upcoming lessons, you'll advance to writing your own functions using the basic functions of the Arduino Wiring programming language.

### Real Mission Insight: Rover Drivers

The engineers who write the commands for rovers like **Perseverance** are called **"Rover Drivers."** They spend their days meticulously planning every movement, turn, and scientific activity. They use specialized software to create a 3D model of the Martian surface, allowing them to test their command sequences virtually before sending them to the rover. This careful planning is essential to ensure the rover doesn't get stuck, fall into a hazard, or damage its instruments.

### Assignment

Write a program for the rover to follow the route represented in the image.

You can refresh your memory of the library functions by revisiting the previous lessons.

### Conclusion

You are awesome! You've gained insight into the concept of a program and its executor. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to control the rover's speedâ€”another critical parameter for safe and efficient exploration.
