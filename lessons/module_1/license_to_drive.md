# Lesson 2: Pilot's Qualification — Maneuver Certification on Mars

## Objective

Write your first independent program to command the Mars rover to drive forward for a specified time, practicing function parameters and certifying your basic piloting skills.

## Mission Briefing

Welcome back, Mars explorer! Having tested your rover’s basic movement in the **Garage**, it's time to earn your **Pilot’s License**. Your mission: write the code yourself to drive the NAME OF THE ROVER rover forward for **5 seconds**. This solo exercise certifies your ability to operate the rover safely and reliably before venturing further onto the Martian surface.

## Scientific Context

In real Mars missions, rover operators often write and test small movement commands to verify each subsystem’s functionality. Mastering these simple commands ensures smooth navigation when exploring complex zones like craters, rock fields, and ice patches.

## Programming Theory

You will continue using the **lineRobot.h** library to control the rover. It provides **functions** — reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

- A **function** can be called by its name to perform an action (like moving forward).
- Functions may have **parameters**, which are values you pass to customize the function's behavior.
  
For example:

```cpp
robot.moveForwardSeconds(seconds);
```

Here, `seconds` is a parameter telling the robot how long to move forward.

Understanding and modifying function parameters is key to making your rover follow precise paths on Mars.

## Your Task

Write a program where the rover moves **forward for 5 seconds**.

Hints:  
- Look back to Lesson 1 for guidance on how to call the move function.  

## Mission Debrief

Congratulations, pilot! Writing this simple program on your own proves you’ve mastered controlling the rover’s basic forward motion. This is an important step toward exploring the surface of Mars autonomously. In the next lesson, you will expand your skills by commanding the rover to perform turns and more complex maneuvers.

Good luck on your journey — the Red Planet awaits!
