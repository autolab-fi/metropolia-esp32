# Lesson 2. License to drive

## Objective
Modify function parameter.

## Introduction
In this lesson, we are granting you the driver's license. Today, you will be writing the program on your own without the instructor's help. However, first, let's cover some theory. We will discuss one of the most important concepts in programming: functions.


##  Theory
In the previous lesson, we used the **lineRobot.h** library, and we will continue using it in the future. It contains functions for controlling the robot, allowing us to easily set our robot in motion.

**Functions** are named blocks of code that perform specific tasks. This means that when you invoke a function, it performs a specific action, such as multiplying two numbers or displaying a message on the console. Some functions have **parameters**; for example, the function **function(param1, param2)** has two parameters, param1 and param2. Parameters allow you to pass data into the function and work with it. In future lessons, you will write your own functions for controlling the robot.

We have already used the function **robot.moveForwardSeconds(seconds)**. This function makes the robot move forward, and the parameter **seconds** sets the duration of the movement in seconds.

## Assignment 
Write a program for the robot to make it drive straight for 5 seconds. You can refer back to the previous lesson to recall how to set the robot in motion. Good luck!

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have written your own program for robot movement! In the next lesson, we will explore the robot's movement in different directions using the lineRobot.h library.
