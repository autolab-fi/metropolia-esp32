# Lesson 1: First Contact — The Mars Rover Test Drive

## Objective

Initiate your first Martian adventure by commanding the NAME OF THE ROVER rover to move forward, using library functions to bring your robotic explorer to life.

## Mission Briefing

Congratulations, engineer! You’ve landed inside the **Garage** zone of your Mars base. Before embarking across the harsh Martian landscape, your first mission is to test basic rover mobility. A smooth start here ensures your rover is ready for greater challenges outside—craters, ice patches, and mysterious rock fields await!

## Scientific Context

Just like real teams at NASA, your first operation checks the rover’s drive system after landing, confirming it can move safely away from the landing site. A successful drive proves all is “go” for exploration.

## Meet Your Rover

> Imagine your NAME OF THE ROVER gleaming in the Martian dusk, its wheels touching red soil for the first time.

1. **Copy the Starter Code**  
   Paste the following code into your robot’s code editor:

   ```cpp
   #include <lineRobot.h>

   void setup() {
     robot.moveForwardSeconds(3);  // Command the rover to advance for 3 seconds
   }

   void loop() {
   }
   ```

2. **Deploy to the Rover**  
   Upload the program to set the wheels in motion.

3. **Observe Your Martian Test Drive**  
   Watch in the output/video feed as your rover moves forward out of the Garage, leaving its first tracks on the simulated Martian terrain.

## Mission Debrief

Not so tough, was it? Even a short roll forward is a giant step for a Martian explorer. You’ve just qualified for the next set of missions—every great adventure begins with a single command. When you’re ready, move on to your next Martian challenge!
