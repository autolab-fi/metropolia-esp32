Now let's test the robot by writing a program for forward movement.

## Instructions
1. Copy the code provided below and paste it into the code editor.
```
#include <lineRobot.h>

void setup() {
  robot.moveForwardSeconds(3);
}

void loop(){
}
```
2. Upload the program to the robot.
3. Observe the program execution results in the output and on the video feed.


## Conclusion
Wasn't hard, was it? A tiny code though a giant leap towards building your robotics skillset. You have successfully acquired the skill to make the robot move. Now, you can proceed to the next lesson!
