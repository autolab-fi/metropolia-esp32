### **Lesson 10: Electric Motor**

## **Lesson objective**

Learn about electric motors and their role in rover systems.

## **Introduction**

In this lesson, you will learn about the fundamental principles of electric motors, specifically focusing on DC motors. We will examine their structure and operation, which are essential for understanding how rovers move and perform tasks on distant planets.

## **Theory**

### **What is an Electric Motor?**

An electric motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy using the force generated by magnetic fields.

Electric motors are classified in various ways, primarily by their power supply voltage:

- **Direct Current (DC) motors**
- **Alternating Current (AC) motors:** asynchronous and synchronous

They can also be classified by the method of power transmission:

- **Brushed motors**
- **Brushless motors**

In this lesson, we will focus on **direct current (DC) motors**, which are a type of brushed motor and are commonly used in robotics for their simplicity and precise control. We will explore their operation without delving deeply into the physics and mathematics.

### **Structure of an Electric Motor**

An electric motor consists of two main parts: the **stator** and the **rotor**. The **stator** is the stationary part that creates a constant magnetic field, provided by permanent magnets in our case. The **rotor** is the rotating part. It is composed of a shaft with windings on several coils.

### **Principle of Operation**

Voltage of different polarities is applied to the brushes, creating magnetic fields in the coil windings that cause the rotor to rotate. As the rotor turns, the brushes switch contact points, which continually remagnetizes the coils with opposite potentials, keeping the rotor in motion as long as voltage is supplied. This simple principle is the foundation for the powerful motors that drive the wheels and robotic arms of rovers like **Perseverance**.

### **Gearbox in Electric Motors**

An electric motor is often equipped with a **gearbox**, which transfers the rotational motion from the motor shaft to the mechanism. A gearbox increases the maximum torque from the motor shaft and reduces the rotational speed. For a line-following rover, the gearbox is critical as it increases torque, allowing the rover to move despite its weight and overcome obstacles. A gearbox consists of a set of gears. You can see the internal structure of a gearbox in the photo below:

For example, the rover on the stage uses motors with a speed of **178 RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)**. In contrast, the motors on the **Curiosity** and **Perseverance** rovers are equipped with custom-built gearboxes that provide the immense torque needed to drive wheels over rocks and sandy slopes on Mars.

## **Assignment**

Let's practice more with rover movement. Write a program for the rover to reach a point on the map. However, remember that you will not be able to use the built-in rover movement functions. The functions: **`moveForwardDistance`**, **`moveBackwardDistance`**, **`turnLeft`**, **`turnRight`**, **`moveForwardSeconds`**, and **`moveBackwardSeconds`** will not work.

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations! In this lesson, you learned about the structure and operation of a simple electric motor. Electric motors are a fascinating area in robotics, with a wide variety of types, each having its own unique application, from miniature drones to planetary rovers.
