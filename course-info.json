  "shortDescription": "Learn C++ programming and robotics using an ESP32-based mobile robot.",
  "fullDescription": "This hands-on course,introduces you to microcontroller programming with the ESP32. You’ll start by writing your first lines of C++ code to control motors, LEDs, and read data from onboard sensors. As the course progresses, you'll take on the challenge of navigating a racing track using simple if statements. Then, you'll dive into more advanced algorithms with a PID regulator to ensure smooth and accurate line-following. The course is supported by an online remote laboratory, allowing you to test your code on real robots from anywhere.",
